I used react for this app so to start it you need to got to the client folder and use command npm start.

There are extensions I used in react that you can install by running the following commands in the client and server folders.

client:
npm install react 
npm install react-router-dom@v6 

server:
npm install mysql2 
npm install mysql
npm install axiom
npm install cors
npm install body-parser
npm install express
npm install nodemon


For the server I used a mySQL server which is from Oracle and uses Oracle language. I used a default server with this configuration.

host: "localhost",
    user: "root",
    password: "password",
    database: "cs157a",

You can run the sqlStatements.sql in the mySQL application to create the database and populate it. 

I was the one who completed this work.
